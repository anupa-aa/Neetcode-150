    "\n",
    "- We will traverse the nums array linearly and for each item we will check if item - 1 or item + 1 is in the array.\n",
    "- We will keep track of the longest chain of consecutive numbers\n",
    "- Initially, this may seem over O(n) complexity : linear traverse is n complexity and for each index we make 2 searches (using binary search as the most efficient this will make each search O(logn) complexity and therefore the combined complexity will be bigTheta(2nlogn).\n",
    "- *HOWEVER,* we can make search require a time complexity of O(n) by converting the nums into a set. This operation will cause an overhead of creating the set (which is O(n) complexity) but each search will be of O(1) complexity since a set uses hashing."
